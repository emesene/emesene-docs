themes
------

Themes are a way to customize the look and feel of emesene without modifying
the code.

Themes are just a defined directory structure that contains images, sounds and
other kinds of files that emesene loads and provides as an option for the user
to choose.

themes are divided in different types.

This directory contains the emoticons used in conversations, the files mapping
to emoticons are mapped in gui.base.Theme in the EMOTES dictionary.

such as emesene logo, status icons etc.

different events happen.

The names should be the same as the ones in the default directory.
